# Quiz: Foundations of Robotics - Managing the world complexity: from linear regression to deep learning.

This quiz is in the form of a jupyter notebook.

All required libraries are installed in your active python environment by the notebook, so this quiz has no prerequisite apart from `jupyter` and `python`.

If you do not have jupyter and python installed, we recommend simply installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com).
Then, you can open jupyter notebook or jupyter lab from Anaconda Navigator.

From jupyter, open the quiz, which is the `quiz.ipynb` file, using python3.

You can then execute the provided code cells one by one.

In this version of the quiz, the answers are not provided.

## Repository files:
### git:
- `.gitattributes`: enables big files (NN weights) to be downloaded when cloning the repo
- `.gitignore`: ignores junk files on commits
- `README.md`: this file
### quiz:
- `quiz.ipynb`: jupyter notebook containing the actual quiz, open this with jupyter
### support material:
- `coco.names`: text file containing the names of the 80 classes present in the COCO dataset, on which the provided YOLO models have been trained
- `street_image.jpg`: example image used to test YOLO in the first part of the quiz
- `yolov3-tiny.cfg`: description of the architecture of a pre-trained tiny YOLO model
- `yolov3-tiny.weights`: weights of a pre-trained tiny YOLO model
- `yolov3.cfg`: description of the architecture of a pre-trained big YOLO model
- `yolov3.weights`: weights of a pre-trained big YOLO model
